SUBJECT DETAILS: 
- Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.
- Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

PROCEDURE SUMMARY:
- In this project, I have performed an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database.
- Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster.
- I will divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers.
